# Creating a link between the TERA-OS and GEE/Google cloud
---

## What we want to accomplish
* Be able to upload images to the GEE
* Create manifests
* Use the images in GEE
---

### To start you'll need to join the NEON-AOP google group link is [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/neon-aop)
Once you have joined the group you will have access to the AOP repo with in GEE, it is under the asset tab and should read "project/neon"
This will allow you to have access to any data that we upload to GEE. There will be a more data in the future but for now it will only be 5Tb.

The next few steps will be for people with access to the TERA-OS (Dell PC) and who want to start data transfers for site projects.
