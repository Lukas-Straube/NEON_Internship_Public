Last Updated: June 15th 2020

Objectives
---
- Understand intermediate image manipulation
- Utilize Google Earth Engine's (GEE) image visualation tools
- Creating your own EVI since GEE does not have a built in function for it

Requirements
---
- Access to GEE software (Accounts require an @gmail.com email address)
- A NEON image to work with (Can be a subset image)
- An intermediate understanding of JavaScript 

To start with this tutorial we must first upload a data set. For this one we will be using the Yellowstone Northern Range (Frog Rock). Start by uploading the image.
```javascript
var YELL = ee.Image("users/jadler/asset_20200204025808999");
```
Once uploaded the first thing we want to do is display an RGB image so that we can see what the image looks like. To display the image is simply two lines. I go more indepth in the previous tutroial.
