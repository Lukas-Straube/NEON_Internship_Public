# Uploading Data as Well as Images/Image Collections
---

To start we need to click over to the assets tab

Once here we need to click on `NEW` and here you will be prompted to select one of five options.

Choose which one you wish to add to your personal assets within GEE. These will not be avaiable to others unless you share it with them specifically. These also cannot be accessed by searching within the `Search places and datasets...`. 

To add a new GeoTIFF we need 5 things; a source file, an asset id, start and end times as well as any additional properties. On note to make here is that, while you can upload multiple GeoTIFF files together they will all be stitched together and the individual tiles wont be accessable to use. Once complete with all the pervious steps you just need to click upload and it should upto a minute to load the image and create the asset. If you are working with more than 6 GB it can take upwards of 5-10 minutes. 

Uploading a shapefile is the same as loading a GeoTIFF however you need to include all the shape file extensions.
